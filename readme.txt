*)about token_required():

When a function is decorated with @token_required, token_required is called and the decorated function is passed as a parameter.
@wraps is a decorator that does some bookkeeping so that decorated_function() appears as func() for the purposes of documentation and debugging. This makes the behavior of the functions a little more natural.
decorated_function will get all of the args and kwargs that were passed to the original view function func(). 
Now that weâ€™ve done what we wanted to do, we run the decorated view function func() with its original arguments.
